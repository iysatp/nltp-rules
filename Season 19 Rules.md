This request can only be made before the CRC has approved the trade.
* (i) Captains cannot be traded.
* (j) The weekly trade deadline will be tiered based on the teams’ current standing.

* (l) If there is a tie on points across tiers, all tied teams will be placed in the lower tier.
* (m) The trade deadline will be the Thursday following week 5 games at 9:59:59 PM ET.
 
##### *Section II - Free Agency Pickups*
* (a) The Basics
  * (1) NLTP teams will use the free agency system if they wish to add a player (or players) to their roster.
  * (2) An NLTP free agent is defined as any player who is registered to play in NLTP, while not playing in MLTP/mLTP.
  * (3) Players may register as free agents until a time determined by the Commissioners.
  * (4) Players may register as a free agent using a form on the sidebar of /r/NLTP.
* (b) Free Agency Open Period / Weekly Timeline
  * (1) The first free agency period will open following the third week of NLTP games.
  * (2) There will be three weeks of standard free agency: after weeks 3, 4, and 5.
  * (3) The deadline for each week's free agent signups will be Wednesday at 9:59:59 PM Eastern.
  * (4) Waiver point totals will be finalized and frozen Thursday night each week at 8:59:59 PM Eastern (or up to three hours later, depending on the team’s tiered trade deadline). Trades involving WP made after this deadline will not be processed until after the agency period closes.
  * (5) Bidding will open Thursday night upon the finalization of WP totals.
  * (6) Any captains who are also members of the CRC will place blind bids before bidding is opened.
  * (7) Bidding will close Friday night each week at 9:59:59 PM Eastern. Bids received after the declared time will not be considered.
  * (8) Free agents will be assigned by Saturday at 9:59:59 PM Eastern and be announced via a public thread on /r/NLTP. Bid information will not be shared with the community.
* (c) Eligible Free Agents
  * (1) Free agents will only include mLTP drops and rookies with no prior LTP experience.
  * (2) mLTP drops must first pass through mLTP free agency before being eligible for NLTP. 
  * (3) To be considered an Eligible Free Agent, the player can not already be assigned to a MLTP, mLTP or NLTP team.
  * (4) Players that were dropped from an MLTP team will be subject to a review by the CRC to determine whether they will be eligible to enter into free agency. The CRC may deem players ineligible if they are considered a risk to the league’s competitive integrity. Players are eligible to sign up as a Free Agent unless the player was removed from MLTP as a disciplinary action or are found guilty of trade manipulation/collusion.
  * (5) Players dropped from MLTP for “gross inactivity” will be ineligible to sign up for NLTP, unless they work their way through the MLTP system to remove the "gross inactivity" tag. An appeal may be made to the CRC by the player.
  * (6) Players dropped from MLTP teams will be restricted to playing A-Team only. A waiver may be granted for the player to play B-Team by the CRC.
  * (7) Players dropped after the final free agency period will not be eligible for NLTP. 
  * (8) The Free Agency list will be linked on the /r/NLTP sidebar. Players highlighted in green have been approved for the next free agency period. Players highlighted in red have been declined. 
* (d) Free Agent Bidding Process
  * (1) Each NLTP team will receive 20 waiver points (WPs) at the start of the season.
  * (2) After games in weeks 2-4, teams will receive additional waiver points each week based on their A-Team League standing at the conclusion of that week's A-Team games. Waiver points awarded by standings are as follows: 1st/2nd - 3 WP, 3rd/4th - 6 WP, 5th/6th - 9 WP, 7th/8th - 12 WP, 9th/10th - 15 WP, 11th/12th - 18 WP, 13th/14th - 21 WP, 15th/16th - 24 WP. Waiver points are NOT awarded according to B-team standings.
  * (3) Further tiebreakers beyond standings points (W/L/OTW/OTL) will not be used. If there is a tie in the standings, all team(s) will be rewarded the average number of WPs for the positions. (For example, if three teams are tied for last place, they will receive the average of 21, 24 and 24 WPs, which is 23 apiece.)
  * (4) Waiver points will be awarded for uploading replays of matches and submitting them to the weekly replays thread. 1 waiver point will be awarded per match, per week. Any team submitting both A and B team replays will be awarded a bonus point, bringing their total to 3 points for that week. The replay must be uploaded to YouTube (not just twitch) and must be the match in full. If the match is recording into multiple parts, please splice them together and upload as one full video or a playlist. Replays must be uploaded by Thursday night at 9:59:59pm ET of a given week to use the waiver points for that week's free agency period.
  * (5) Failure to upload stats will result in a loss of 3 WPs per half. Therefore, missing an entire match's stats will result in the loss of 12 WPs.
  * (6) Other incentive based waiver points may be awarded and deducted from a team regulated by the league leadership. Waiver points may be awarded by the CRC for positive actions. Waiver points may be removed if a captain fails to meet the standards required of them by the league.
  * (7) If a player on a team is called up to MLTP and elects not to become a Dual Eligible Player, that team is awarded 100 waiver points that can only be used on a single player.
  * (8) All teams will have the opportunity to make a bid on any unclaimed eligible player. When the waiver period expires, the player will be awarded to the team with the highest valid waiver bid on that unclaimed, eligible player.
  * (9) If multiple bids are received from a single team, only the most recent submission will be considered valid. It is the responsibility of the NLTP Captain to fill the form out properly.
  * (10) If two teams have identical bids for a single player, the team with the worse season record will obtain the Free Agent. If records are identical, cap difference will be used as the second tie-breaker, followed by caps against. (Team with more caps against receives player)
  * (11) Teams with the highest bid will be assigned the requested player at the cost they bid. Waiver points will be deducted from the team's total available waiver points.
  * (12) Bids will automatically be reduced to never exceed available waiver points. If a Team has 20 waiver points and submits a bid sheet: Player A-15; Player B-10; Player C-5 and wins Player A. Their bid for Player-B will reduce to 5 and have a priority over Player C which will remain at 5.
  * (13) A bid of zero waiver points on a specific player is valid. Waiver points must be used in whole numbers and non-negative.
  * (14) Free Agents that receive no bids will be auto-assigned to a team.
  * (15) Eligible captains will be allowed to claim themselves from the waivers at the cost of 100 waiver points.
  * (16) Eligible co-captains seeking entry into NLTP must agree to enter into the competitive bidding process, and are thus stripped of their title unless claimed by the team in which they are a co-captain. If a co-captain refuses to play for another team, they may face removal from the league on the grounds of collusion with their original team.
* (e) Rookie Free Agency Extension
  * (1) An extended free agency period will be held after week 6.
  * (2) Players eligible for these free agency periods will only be those that meet all of the following criteria:
    * (i) Do not have LTP experience
    * (ii) Have enough public experience to determine the player is not a smurf account.
    * (iii) Are determined eligible by the CRC. Players that are considered to likely be above the level of rotational B-team player will be denied by the CRC in most cases.
  * (3) The free agency assignment process will work the same as the traditional free agency process.
* (f) Future WPs
  * (1) Future waiver points are non-existent and will not be allowed to be traded.
* (g) WP Trades
  * (1) Waiver points can be traded. The CRC will closely monitor all trades to ensure fairness.
* (h) NLTP Specific Instructions
  * (1) NLTP players can reject being signed onto an MLTP team if they think it is in their best interest. Please refer to MLTP’s rules about rejecting callup offers and future eligibility. 
  * (2) NLTP players will need to publicly accept or reject an MLTP call-up offer within 72 hours of the call-up being announced by MLTP. If there is no decision before the 72 hours are up, it will be assumed that the call-up was accepted and NLTP will proceed as such.
  * (3) Active NLTP players that are called up to a Majors or Minors team AND actively play in either of the Sun. (Majors) or Mon. (Minors) Games will be ineligible for NLTP B-team and may only finish the current week on their NLTP A-team.
  * (4) Active NLTP players that are loaned to a Majors or Minors team will be eligible to play in NLTP and will be subject to normal NLTP eligibility rules and restrictions.
##### *Section III - Loans Within NLTP*
* (a) If a team cannot fill a full roster for a week’s game, they may elect to loan a player from another team. 
* (b) All loans must be approved by a member of the NLTP CRC before the player plays.
  * (1) Failure to acquire approval may result in punishments such as, but not limited to, forfeiture, forced replay and waiver point deduction.
* (c) Loans will only be approved in cases where a team would otherwise forfeit.
* (d) Players with significant A-Team minutes will not be allowed to be loaned.
  * (1) Significant A-Team minutes will be defined as more than 10 minutes of A-Team play per week. Example: If a player has played 40 total A-Team minutes through week 2, they may not be loaned in week 3 (20 minutes per week average).
* (e) A loaned player may not play for 2 different teams in a single week.
* (f) Teams loaning a player may be rewarded with waiver points. The total will be determined the NLTP CRC at the time of the loan.
  
##### *Section IV - Drops*
* (a) Players taken during the auction draft may be dropped for gross inactivity at any time after week one. Players taken during the snake draft or in free agency will not be eligible to be dropped.
  * (1) Gross inactivity is to be determined on a case by case basis by the NLTP CRC.
  * (2) Players may only be dropped by the team that drafted them.
* (b) Drop requests will be handled on a case by case basis with the full NLTP CRC acting as arbitrators. Captains may request a drop by sending a message to the CRC with the player’s name and any accompanying information they deem useful.
* (c) Following a drop request, the player in question will be messaged by the NLTP CRC in order to verify the situation and gather any additional information.
* (d) After conferring with both the captain and the player to be dropped, the NLTP CRC will determine whether the player is to be dropped, held or forcibly traded. If the player is dropped for gross inactivity, the team will be rewarded with the equivalent of half of the player's auction value, rounded down.
* (e) A player dropped for gross inactivity will be ineligible to be added by any team for the remainder of the season, including the team that dropped them.

##### *Section V - Removal From Captaincy*
* (a) Players may be removed from captaincy by the CRC or willfully step down if they are no longer able to handle their responsibilities as a captain. 
* (b) If a captain resigns, they will still be allowed to play for their team, but unable to be traded. 
* (c) In special circumstances, where a captain is removed not by their own choice, the CRC may reassign them to a different team or include them in free agency. 

## Article III - Draft
##### *Section I - General Draft Information*
* (a) The NLTP draft will be two parts. The first part will be an auction draft followed by a snake draft.
* (b) The draft date and time will be announced on /r/NLTP. Captains are expected to arrive early to the draft.

##### *Section II - Auction Draft*
* (a) The nomination order will be randomly assigned.
* (b) Nominations spots may not be traded.
* (c) The auction draft will be 4 rounds and will bring teams to 5 total players.
* (d) Each team will get a budget of TagCoins (TCs) determined by the NLTP CRC on a case-by-case basis.
  * (1) There will be tiers that a playing captain can be assigned to.
  * (2) All tiers do not need to be represented in a single season. For example, the 90tc tier doesn't need to have any captains assigned to it.
  * (3) Tiers may not include an even amount of captains in each tier. For example, the 100tc tier could have 6 captains while the 90tc tier has 2, etc.
* (e) Nominations have a starting bid. The starting bid is chosen by the nominating captain and may be anywhere between 0TC and that captain's remaining TagCoins.
* (f) If a captain takes more than 30 seconds to nominate a player, a player may be automatically nominated for them at a starting bid of 0TC. The player will be the top undrafted player on the "Big Board" from that captain's home server.
* (g) If a captain has already drafted the maximum number of players in the auction (3), their nomination spot will be skipped and the eligible captain in line will nominate.
* (h) TagCoins
  * (1) Trades involving TagCoins during the draft are allowed.
  * (2) Remaining TagCoins are not carried into the season in any way.
* (i) Non-Playing Captains (NPC)
  * (1) Any captain who is playing in MLTP or mLTP is automatically designated as an NPC.
  * (2) Any captain who doesn't wish to play any NLTP matches during the season can designate themselves as an NPC.
  * (3) NPCs who are dropped from MLTP and NPCs that wish to declare for free agency may acquire themselves through free agency for 100 waiver points.
  * (4) Captain's must declare themselves as an NPC by the Friday before the draft.
  * (5) To declare as an NPC, the captain must select any one player registered for the draft to join their NLTP team. This will be called a "preliminary player."
  * (6) The preliminary player must agree to join this team. Once a player has agreed to join a team, they will not be permitted to switch teams.
  * (7) In the event that a preliminary player is chosen for an NPC, the TagCoin tier will be evaluated based on the preliminary player picked, not the captain.
  * (8) A captain that wishes to declare as an NPC, but has not found a preliminary player by the deadline, will have two options. They will either need to become a playing captain or they will need to be replaced as a captain. The CRC may help in finding a preliminary player at their discretion.
* (j) B Team Non-Playing Captains (NPCb)
  * (1) Any captain with predominantly B Team experience may petition the Commissioners to be granted the title of NPCb
  * (2) NPCb captain declaration and job requirements are the same as in the NPC designation, with the exception being that they may play B Team, while NPCs may not.
  * (3) If granted the title of NPCb, the Commissioners will decide the snake draft pick they deem appropriate for the captain to be drafted.
  * (4) An NPCb may not trade the designated snake draft pick decided by the Commissioners, or use that pick to draft anyone but themselves.
  * (5) NPCb captains can play no more than 40 minutes of A-team during the regular season unless given specific approval by the Commissioners under extraordinary circumstances.
  * (6) NPCb captains are not eligible for A-team playoffs unless given specific approval by the Commissioners under extraordinary circumstances.

##### *Section III - Snake Draft*
* (a) The snake draft will follow the auction draft after a short break determined at the time of the draft.
* (b) The snake draft order will be determined by the amount of remaining TagCoins of each team, prorated by their initial balance.
  * (1) The team with the most TagCoins remaining, will be 1st draft pick in the first round.
  * (2) Ties will be resolved using a random generator.
  * (3) Proration example:
    * Captain A begins with 100 TCs and ends with 6 TCs, or 6 pro-rated TCs.
    * Captain B begins with 100 TCs and ends with 0 TCs, or 0 pro-rated TCs.
    * Captain C begins with 80 TCs and ends with 6 TCs, or 7.5 pro-rated TCs (100/80*6)
    * Captain D begins with 80 TCs and ends with 0 TCs, or 0 pro-rated TCs
    * The draft order would be: C, A, D, B
* (c) The snake draft will continue until every eligible player signed up has been placed on a team.

##### *Section IV - Eligibility*

* (a) Players who have signed up for the MLTP draft and are not on an MLTP roster at the end of the draft will be eligible, and automatically entered into, the NLTP Draft.
  * (1) If an overqualified player indicates that they are not available on Mondays for the MLTP draft, they will not be eligible for NLTP. Players qualify for this rule if they meet any of the following criteria for their most recent season of NALTP:
  * (a) They played the majority of their minutes in MLTP (majors or minors).
  * (b) They played at least half of total available regular-season minutes in minors AND had a positional or total NISH of 70 or higher.
  * (c) They played at least half of total available regular-season minutes in NLTP-A AND had a positional or total NISH of 90 or higher.
  * (d) The player is deemed by the CRC to be beyond the skill level of NLTP.
  * (2) Players will not be permitted to switch positions to circumvent this rule.
  * (3) It is the responsibility of the player to confirm their eligibility for the draft. 
* (b) Players who have no more than 100 minutes of competitive experience will be eligible to sign up for the NLTP Draft even if they did not enter the MLTP draft.
* (c) Signups indicating zero availability on both Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be removed.
  * (1) This rule is extended to any players who indicate in their signup comment or directly to a captain that they are unlikely to attend most/all games.
* (d) All other eligibility cases will be dealt with on a case-by-case measure through the NLTP CRC.
* (e) Playing co-captains may not be reserved by any team prior the NLTP draft. If a player is named a co-captain, they are still eligible to be drafted by any team during the draft. If the player is drafted to another team besides the team they are a co-captain of, their co-captaincy will be removed.
* (f) The CRC may enforce minute restrictions on a player commensurate to the availability they indicate in their signup comment.
  * (1) These minute restrictions will be communicated to the player and all captains prior to the NLTP draft.
* (g) On A-Team, positional restrictions will be enforced for all players that list that they will play only one position ("Offense only" or "Defense only") in their signup form. B-Team players who played more than half of their minutes on A-Team or above in either the current season or their previous season will be restricted to the position they signed up as. B-Team players who had above an 80 positional or total NISH in their previous season will also be restricted to the position they signed up as. For this last case captains may request a waiver from the CRC for unusual or edge cases.
* (h) If a player's signup indicates that they will not use a microphone, they must be muted during any official NLTP match. Failure to mute may result in the deduction of waiver points or points at the discretion of the CRC.

##### *Section V - Dual Eligibility* 
* (a) Full dual eligibility will be allowed. If a player is called up to an MLTP team, the captain will be given until the next week’s games to decide whether to keep the player on their roster and grant dual eligibility, or to allow the player to play exclusively for the MLTP team and accept 100 WPs as compensation. It is expected that the captain and player communicate to decide the best option for the player and the team, and the decision to play for both teams must be mutual between the player and captain.
* (b) If applicable, players who are drafted in the Dual Eligible slots during the MLTP and mLTP drafts - but not in any other slots - will be considered fully eligible for NLTP.

## Article IV - Matches

##### *Section I - Match Scheduling*
* (a) Matches are scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, but can be rescheduled to any day within 48 hours of the default game time with notification of the CRC.
* (b) A points system will be used alongside a team's record to determine league standings.
  * (1) 3 points are assigned for a win
  * (2) 2 points are assigned for an overtime win
  * (3) 1 point is assigned for an overtime loss
  * (4) 0 points are assigned for a loss
* (c) At the beginning of the season, each captain will be asked to submit their team’s default game time. These times can be different for A-team and B-team. The time will remain on the default days (i.e., Tuesday and Wednesday), and will fall within boundaries to be determined by the CRC. In matches between played between two eastern teams or two western teams, the default gametime will be the average of the two teams’ default gametime. Example: Team A’s default gametime is 8:30 PM ET. Team B’s default gametime is 10 PM ET. By default, this match will begin at 9:15 PM ET. 
* (d) Teams may be allowed to change their default times at the beginning of the season if there are extenuating circumstances. Captains will need to discuss this with the CRC.
* (e) The default time for all matches between western (LA, SF, SEA) teams and non-western teams will be 10 PM ET
* (f) Captains are allowed to change gametime by a captain’s agreement.
* (g) Teams must finalize match times 24 hours before the default game time.
* (h) If teams do not finalize the match 24 hours before the match starts, it will be assumed that the match will be taking place at the default time.
* (i) If a team does not schedule their match at least 24 hours before the default game time, they will be allowed to reschedule up until 1 hour before default game time. A captain must make a post to the NLTP subreddit detailing the reschedule.

##### *Section II - Match Server Logistics*
* (a) Suggested home servers will be assigned by the NLTP CRC at the time of the offer to be a captain.
* (b) Valid home servers for Season 18 include the following North American servers: New York, Toronto, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.
* (c) Teams may be allowed to change their home servers at the beginning of the season if there are extenuating circumstances. Captains will need to discuss this with the CRC.
* (d) Commissioners reserve the right to grant additional server changes throughout the season to teams with special circumstances.
* (e) Server selection will be based on the Server Chart. Captains may mutually agree to play on different servers. If the captains are unable to come to a mutual agreement, the CRC may determine game server according to the teams' declared home servers.
* (f) Matches that are played on two servers (according to the Server Chart or agreement between captains) will be in an A/B/B/A format. Example: New York/Chicago goes NY/CHI/CHI/NY, or CHI/NY/NY/CHI.

##### *Section III - Match Rules*
* (a) Each match consists of two separate games, each of which is 20 minutes long. Each game is two 10 minute halves. In cases of split servers, the teams will alternate servers for each half. Games which end in a tie will go into overtime.
* (b) At the conclusion of the match, screenshots/tagpro.eu are to be posted to the wire thread. To preserve statistics, tagpro.eu links need to be submitted after the games under the "Captain Center" tab of TagProLeague (remember to submit all relevant statistics, including those of a timeout or overtime). If these methods are not followed, statistics will not be kept, and penalties will be applied.
* (c) Teams are discouraged from taking overly long between halves. However, problems arise and halves may start late. In this case, the team that is ready to start is highly encouraged to keep their complaints to a minimum - see the etiquette section for more information. If it takes over 15 minutes, the team delaying forfeits the entire game.
* (d) Teams are allowed 1 (or more) players from their team to spectate, but they must be in a different Discord channel than the players in the match, and may not communicate with them in any way while they are playing. Please see the Substitutes Section for more information on this.
* (e) Captains and co-captains that are not actively playing in their A-team match are allowed to listen in only to A-team communication while spectating the game. They must remain muted.
* (f) Given NLTP's deviation from timeouts during competitive matches, any player wishing to serve as a live substitute can spectate the game and listen in to the A-team communication, but must remain muted until they enter the game. This applies only to live substitutions.

##### *Section IV - Overtime*
* (a) Any game that ends in a tie will go to overtime.
* (b) The overtime period will be played with "Golden Cap" settings, which are the same as regular time with the following two changes:
  * (1) Time will be set to 20 minutes.
  * (2) Cap limit will be set to 1.
* (c) Overtime periods will be played until a winner is found.
* (d) Overtime stats will not be counted towards regular season stats. They are submitted for scoring purposes only and are submitted by checking the "overtime" box when submitting stats. If there are multiple overtime periods, please use the "timeout" checkbox to add more periods.

##### *Article V - Substitutions & Timeouts*
* (a) Timeouts are no longer permitted in NLTP Matches, except during 2 specific cases.
  * (1) If players do not make it into the game from the joiner page after the group leader launches the half, timeout may be called before the game begins and the game will go back to group to retry the launch.
  * (2) If 2 or more players from the same team lag out at the same time, timeout may be called.
* (b) Timeouts during game will follow these rules:
  * (1) Once the timeout is called, the team calling the timeout must return their flag to their base before the timeout takes effect. An instant regrab does not count as keeping the flag "out of base".
  * (2) If the team calling the timeout is winning when the timeout is called, the time will be rounded up to the nearest whole minute.
  * (3) If the team calling the timeout is losing when the timeout is called, the time will be rounded down to the nearest whole minute.
  * (4) Game settings will remain the same, except remaining time, which will follow rules (2) and (3) above.
  * (5) Remember to save EU's from before and after the timeout, since TagProLeague can handle timeouts.
* (c) Live substitutions are permitted.
  * (1) Teams can make as many substitutions as they like.
  * (2) If players are having trouble with lag, they will be permitted up to two refreshes before being forced to substitute.
  * (3) The substitute can be in the "Spectator" slot and can be listening in on Discord, but they must be muted until the substitution is made.
  * (4) If a substituting team has more than four active players for an extensive amount of time, the team may be assessed a penalty determined by the commissioners.
  * (5) If a player is unable to leave the match, an inactive fifth ball may remain in play, provided it is not in a spot that disrupts play. If the inactive ball is in such a location for an extensive amount of time, the four active players must attempt to move the inactive player to a less disruptive spot. Teams with a fifth inactive ball that disrupts play may be assessed a penalty determined by the commissioners.

## Article VI - Cheating
##### *Section I - Cheating*
* (a) Cheating is strictly prohibited.
* (b) Any player caught cheating will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis as determined by the NLTP Commissioners. The more severe the cheating, the more severe the punishment. NLTP Commissioners may also take any other actions (whether related to cheating or not) which they feel are for the good of the league.
  * (1) Certain scripts are prohibited on any production server and are illegal in both public, private, and league matches. If a player uses a prohibited script on a production server, their name will be forwarded to the NLTP Commissioners to determine a punishment determined on a case-by-case basis.
  * (2) Responsibility lies solely with the player to stay informed of any prohibited scripts on production servers.
* (d) Cheating includes, but is not limited to: smurfing within the league, zoom-out scripts and non-playing teammates communicating with playing teammates.
  * (1) Smurfing - The act of playing or signing up under a different name than a player's most well known name, without disclosing that name in the signup. A player's name on TagPro League is a good example of their most well known name.
  * (2) Impersonation: All players will be expected to play under the registered name that they used in their signup. Please take this into account when submitting your signup. Failure to comply when requested may result in penalties, including but not limited to team WP deductions, team point deductions and suspension from the league.
* (e) Switching teams to get a better start position is allowed; however, players are prohibited from refreshing before a half starts, unless it is completely needed in order to fix a black screen or some other malfunction.

##### *Section II - Approved (Legal) Scripts*
* (a) Games are played with the "no scripts" option in groups and therefore no scripts are allowed.

##### *Section III - Prohibited (Illegal) Scripts*
* (a) All scripts not found in the "no scripts" group option.
* (b) Bomb/boost/powerup timers are strictly prohibited.
* (c) Bots are strictly prohibited.

## Article VII - Etiquette
##### *Section I - Etiquette*
* (a) This is a fun game, and a fun league. This is not very serious, we are just out there to have a good time.
* (b) Any hate speech will result in an immediate ban from the season.
* (c) Players are encouraged to talk up their own skills, and even be arrogant about it, but are not allowed to put down other players or teams unless it is clear it is a joke.
* (d) Players are encouraged to talk smack before the match, but afterwards be cool about everything - especially the winning team.
* (e) Teams are subject to punishment if their players or captains partake in any of the following: Unnecessary spam to /r/NLTP or captains' modmail or spam to Discord channels.
* (f) There is a catch-all "Don't Be a Dick" rule, of which any number of things it can encompass. Violations of the "DBAD" rule will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Rules Committee.

##### *Section II - In-game communication*
* (a) Group chat will not be allowed during matches unless required (e.g., a call for back to group).
  * (1) Violation of this rule will result in a warning and may result in a ban or team forfeiture if the problem persists or is deemed unruly by the CRC.
* (b) Captains may allow any number of players into the group link for a match. However, if this becomes an issue, the opposing captain may ask for non-essential players to leave.
  * (1) Essential players/attendees include: 
   * The four starting players for each team
   * Up to two substitutes per team
   * Up to two captains per team
   * Member(s) of the CRC
* (c) CRC members have the right to enter any official NLTP match group if requested. 

##### *Section III - Manipulation*
* (a) Players determined to be manipulating their value prior to the draft may be removed from the draft and/or subject to punishment in NALTP.
  * (1) Manipulation includes, but is not limited to: lying about availability, lying about ping or location, providing any other false information in signups, providing captains with different information, or making concerted efforts to land on a specific team.
  * (2) If a captain asks a player if they want to play for them, the player is allowed to say no. This includes interest forms, direct messages, or any other form of communication.
  * (3) If a player informs a captain that they do not want to play for them without being solicited by the captain, it will be considered manipulation. 
* (b) Players determined to be manipulating to alter their trade value may also be punished. Teams who benefit from this may be punished as well. 
  * (1) Giving captains an ultimatum to trade you is not acceptable. For example, “Trade me or I’m ghosting” is a bannable offense.
  * (2) If there is a problem with a team, you can always ask for a trade and explain your reasoning to the captain. However, you signed up to participate in the league regardless of which captain drafts you and which team you end up on.

## Article VIII - Playoffs
##### *Section I - Teams and Seeding*
* (a) The number of playoff teams for Season 18 is TBD.
* (b) Seeding is determined at the end of the regular season games based on standings throughout the league.
* (c) Seeding will be based on overall record for the season.
* (d) Each round of the playoffs will feature a playoff draft. Prior to the Equidistant Eight, the top four seeded teams will select which of the fifth through eighth seeded teams they would like to play. Teams cannot choose another team within the top four seeds. Thus, the first seed will select either the 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th seed. The 2nd seed will then pick one of the remaining three. The third seed will pick from the remaining two, and the 4th seed will play the team not selected. In the Foci Four, the top seed will get the option of playing the lowest seed or the second lowest seed.

## Section II - Tiebreakers

  * (3) Cap differential against common opponents.
  * (4) Total cap differential.
  * (5) Total caps scored
  * (6) A 5-minute OFM with one player from each team. The player must be      eligible for that team’s league (i.e., an A-teamer cannot OFM for a B-team matchup), and the captain will be allowed to choose the player. 
* (b) Tiebreakers between three teams with an equal number of points will be determined by the following:
  * (1) Points acquired in head-to-head matches; if all tied teams have not played each other, then this rule is skipped
  * (2) Points acquired vs. common opponents
  * (3) Cap differential against common opponents.
  * (4) Total cap differential.
  * (5) Total caps scored.
  * (6) A 5-minute OFM round-robin tournament with one player from each team. The player must be eligible for that team’s league (i.e., an A-teamer cannot OFM for a B-team matchup), and the captain will be allowed to choose the player.
* (c) If the seeding of one team is determined in a three-or-more team tiebreaker but other seeds aren't, tiebreak rules continue as they are and do not reset with all remaining teams.

##### *Section III - Maps*

  * (1) Following the regular season a vote will be held among the captains to narrow the pool of maps from 14 to 7.
  * (2) There will be separate votes for A- and B-Team.
  * (2) The team with the higher seed will pick what team they would like to be for the Pick/Ban (Team 1 or Team 2).
  * (3) The Pick/Ban must be completed between the two captains no more than 48 hours after match-ups are declared.
  * (4) The results of the Pick/Ban must be messaged to the NLTP CRC by both captains in the table format shown in (6).
  * (5) Teams will take turns picking from the available maps and assigning them to available games. The first pick may choose any map played during the regular season and assign it to any game from 1-7. The next team may choose any map except the first one and assign it to any remaining game, etc.
* (6) Table:

Round | Team 1 | Team 2
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 | Pick map/game | Pick map/game
2 | Pick map/game | Pick map/game

* (d) Individual games may not end in a tie. If a game is tied after 10 minutes, sudden death OT with powerups delayed shall be played until a winner is found.
* (e) Teams should switch sides to abide by the color selections of the Pick/Ban.
* (f) Game settings from the regular season still apply.
* (g) Timeout rules are the same as the regular season.

<sup>\**If Necessary*</sup>

##### *Section V - Eligibility Requirements*
* (a) Anyone on a team's roster, except for an NPCb captain, is eligible to play on A-team.
* (b) If a team's A-team and B-team are both in the playoffs, players who have played more than 10 minutes in the A-team match are ineligible for B-team.
* (c) If, at the beginning of the week, a team's A-team is not in playoff contention but its B-team is, the top four players in A-team minutes during the regular season are ineligible for B-team. This includes players who were called up to MLTP. Commissioners should notify captains with a list of their ineligible players at the end of the regular season.
* (d) Teams may appeal with the commissioners to switch A-team eligibility between two players under special circumstances. For example, if a player has joined the season late and will start A-team during the playoffs, but a different player who will no longer start is in the top 4 of A-team minutes, the captain may appeal to have the former player be ineligible for B-team instead of the latter.
* (e) To be eligible for B-team playoffs a player must play at least 40 minutes of B-team or A-team during the regular season. All players failing this requirement will not be eligible without receiving a waiver from the CRC.
* (f) If a team's regular A-team player is unavailable for a week and is replaced by a B-team player, that B-team player is eligible to play on both A-team and B-team for that week. If the regular A-team player plays on B-team that week, the B-team sub is not eligible to play B-team.
* (g) After week 4, the four players who have played the most minutes on their A-team will not be eligible to play B-team unless the CRC grants a waiver. If more than four players are determined to be A-team by virtue of minutes, then the captain will declare the fourth player ineligible for B-team from the players who have the least amount of A-team minutes from the eligible group. Captains can request a waiver to replace a player in the top four minutes with another player if they intend for that player to be the A-team starter moving forward. Examples may include, but are not limited to, a free agent pick up, a player who was unavailable in the beginning weeks of the season, or a player who has won the starting spot late in the season.

* (b) In the event of a forfeit of a match, the wins and losses will count as usual in the standings, with the cap differential for the winning and losing team being the third-largest positive and negative cap differential for all other matches that week, respectively. If only one game is forfeited, the cap differential will be the third-largest differential for that game of the week. (Ex. If Game 2 is a forfeit, the cap diff is that of all other Game 2's for that week.)
* (c) The NLTP commissioners may demand full access to a team's subreddit (including modmail), Discord or other form of communication without needing to provide a reason, and shall be granted this access with speed.
